## Chosen Pre-trained Model:

The VGG16 pre-trained model is chosen as the deep learning model for extracting image vectors.
The VGG16 model has shown excellent performance in image recognition tasks and has been trained on a large-scale dataset (ImageNet).
The model consists of convolutional layers, which can capture intricate visual features from images.


 ## Similarity Measure:

Cosine similarity measure is selected as the similarity measure to compare image vectors.
Cosine similarity is commonly used for comparing high-dimensional vectors like image embeddings as it is unaffected by vector magnitude.
By using cosine similarity, we can effectively measure the similarity between the query image vector and the dataset image vectors.


# 1) Assumes Assuming that the pre-trained VGG16 model has been adequately trained on a large-scale dataset such as ImageNet.
# 2)The assumption is that the pre-trained VGG16 model has learned relevant and discriminative features for fruit images.
